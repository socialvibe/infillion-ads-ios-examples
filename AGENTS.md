# AGENTS.md

Behavioral and workflow guidelines for AI coding agents (and humans) working in this repo. Product and run information lives in [README.md](README.md); build, test, and release instructions live in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). This file is about *how we work*, so they don't overlap.

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

## 0. MCP Tools

- **Jira:** Atlassian MCP — project `PI` ("PRGM - Publisher Integration"). Read, create, and transition tickets (see §5, §7).
- **GitHub:** use the `gh` CLI for PRs and issues.

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

## 5. Session Start

At the start of every session, in order:

1. Read [README.md](README.md) and [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for project facts, and `CLAUDE-LOCAL.md` if present (optional, git-ignored personal notes). Incorporate their key data into your working context.
2. Check the current branch (`git branch --show-current`):
   - **If on the default branch (`main`) and `origin` exists**:
     1. Fast-forward local `main` to `origin/main` (`git fetch origin && git pull --ff-only`). Never branch from a stale `main`.
     2. Ask for the ticket number using `AskUserQuestion` with "Type Ticket Number" as the first option (follow up asking the user to type it if selected) and "Use NONE-001" as the second.
     3. Ask whether this is feature or bug work and for a short branch description. Create and switch to `feature/<TICKET>/<description>` or `bugfix/<TICKET>/<description>` before changing code.
   - **If on local `main` and no remote exists**: the repository is still being bootstrapped. Direct work on `main` is allowed until the initial remote push.
   - **If on a feature or bugfix branch**: derive the ticket from the branch name (e.g. `feature/PI-3333/fix-something` → `PI-3333`, other possible prefixes: `ADX-XXXX`). Confirm it with the user in a single line of text.
3. Store the ticket for the rest of the session — reuse it for branch naming, commit messages, and PR titles without asking again.
4. **Commit messages** use `<TICKET> - <MESSAGE>` (e.g. `PI-3670 - Restructure ad tags catalog`). See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) § Commits.

## 6. Versioning

**Every PR bumps the app version exactly once.**

Never commit directly to remote `main`; company branch protection requires an approved PR and a manual merge.

Bump the version exactly as described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) § Versioning — which values to change, where they live, and by how much. Don't change any version value it doesn't list. If the rules are missing or unclear, stop and ask instead of guessing.

The pull-request workflow fails if either increment is missing or incorrect. After an approved PR is manually merged to `main`, the release workflow creates tag `v<VERSION_NAME>` and the matching GitHub release.

## 7. Pull Requests

If directly opening PRs on GitHub you **MUST**:

1. Use the ticket number and short change description as the pull request title in the same form as commits: `PI-3670 - <short description>`. **PR title must be under 80 characters** (company policy).
2. Use the pull request template at `.github/pull_request_template.md` as the PR description and fill it with data from the change.
3. After the PR is open, offer to open it in the browser using `gh pr view --web`.
4. **Never offer to merge a PR.** PRs must be approved under company policy and manually merged through the GitHub web interface.

---

**These guidelines are working if:** fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.
